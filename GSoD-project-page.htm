  The DevoWorm group (affiliated with of the OpenWorm Foundation) is a distributed collaborative group advancing research in the areas of Computational Developmental Biology, Data Science, and Machine Learning. For Google Season of Docs, we would like to develop documentation infrastructure in the form of a secure workspace ecosystem that will allow us to encourage community standards and analytical reproducibility. <BR><BR>
This project will build upon the work that will be advanced during this year's Google Summer of Code, which will result in a user front-end for our ML/AI education and research efforts. A documentation infrastructure sitting below the hood of this front-end will aid us in our mission of offering integrated instruction and research engagement. During the Season of Docs, the intern will work on two components:  <BR><BR>
1) A secure workspace for data storage and manipulation. Users should be able to access data from our organizational collection (DevoZoo) as well as submit new sources of data for inclusion into the collection. We would also like for there to be some sort of interface with various social media channels (Twitter, ResearchGate, Github, Slack) to share papers and insights as necessary to enable group learning and research insight.  <BR><BR>
2) An interface to present analysis options to users of varying skill levels. This includes building upon an interface that guides users (often with limited expertise in ML/AI) through the relevant assumptions and overall suitability of different algorithms and classes of analysis for their particular problem. The interface should be documentation-rich, meaning that users should be able to access documents related to community-standards and further information about each type of analytical tool in our library. Accompanying this will be the development of a computational notebook template allowing users to access Wiki resources and share lab notes across analyses.  <BR><BR>
The successful applicant will attend our group meetings and interact with a diverse community of collaborators. <BR><BR>

   <H3> Building Epistemological Directories (EDs) for Interdisciplinary Research</H3>
  Data Reuse Project <A HREF="https://data-reuse.weebly.com"> website</A>, Github repo <A HREF="https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Models-for-Data-Reuse"> website</A>

Building upon work being conducted by the Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory’s Data Reuse Initiative on Epistemological Directries (EDs), we seek to build a set of directories, annotated bibliographies, and graphical representations that define the scope of field-specific knowledge. The Epistemological Directory (ED) is an innovation of our lab recently presented at csv,conf, and provides a means to educate contributors on scholarly topics where they have deficiencies in expertise. With Season of Docs support, we will be able to develop EDs into a truly comprehensive referential system for new contributors to get up to speed on unfamiliar topics. <BR><BR>
Our plan is to systematize and expand the current framework of EDs. Our revised version of the ED concept will unify a number of topics associated with the Orthogonal Lab’s research portfolio. These topics include: Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, Simulation, Philosophy of Science, and Open Science. The basic structure of an ED includes documentation (tutorials, links, discussions, and bibliography) for specific topics, visualizations that define the development of a field, key equations and methodologies, archives of data sets and key findings, and linkages between distinct fields in the form of potential connections and modes of investigation. It is this last issue that is potentially the most useful to our organization. <BR><BR>
The priorities for this Season of Docs would be as follows: start development on a new Laboratory-wide ED, make linkages between issues and fields in a few of our existing EDs, and (if time permits) contribute to a set of community standards for implementing EDs on other topics and in other organizations. <BR><BR>
